                      <p>Performance and optimization of your website are important because it can determine the number of people visiting your website, the traffic flow on your website and the usability experience of your website. Today I will discuss the tools I used when validating and optimizing my website portfolio.</p>

                      <h2>Validating your code</h2>
                      <div class="blog_links">
                        <p>When you create a website, you must always optimise the website by validating the code on the website this helps prevent any unwanted error. A website I like to use is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"><strong>The W3C Markup Validation Service</strong></a>not only does it identify any problems in the code, but it also makes it easier to maintain the website. You can validate the website either by entering the URI of the website, you can upload the file from your computer, or you can use the direct input option to directly enter the code on the validation service website. The validation service does not have to be only used for validating your website it can also be used to identify any errors in the code that are preventing it from working.</p>

                        <h2>Website Optimization</h2>
                        <div class="blog_links">
                        <p>Website optimization is the process of improving the SEO score by increasing the rank of the website in the search results. Nevertheless, websites with high ranking have a higher chance of being placed further up the search results (Admin, 2019). The website I used to optimize my website is <a href="https://www.seobility.net/en/seocheck/"><strong>Seoability</strong></a>.This website is simple to use you just  enter the website domain it will identify SEO issues and then highlights the most important issues that are affecting your website. Seoability scores your website based on meta-information, page quality,page structure, link structure, server and external factors.Each of these sections are scored separately and you get an overall score for the webpage.The score helps indicate the quality of the webpage. Apart from the optimization of the website I compressed the images using <a href="https://tinyjpg.com"><strong>Tiny jpg</strong></a>. This website helps reduce the file size of the images and it's very simple to use just drag and drop your image and it will compress the image size for you.</p>

                          <p>Above is an example of my website being optimized on Seoability.</p>

                        <h2>Search engine optimization</h2>
                        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is very important to a developer like me because using SEO correctly can increase the traffic on the website. SEO is very important because 93% of online experiences begin in search engines and around 67,000 searches occur every second on Google and 46% of those searches are local (Nikolovska, 2019). SEO helps with the ranking of a website on search results. Ranking of a website depends on many parameters such as searches that are relevant to a particular search are displayed first. Using keyword optimization can increase the traffic on your website because it makes it easier for the search engine to know what the topic of your website/page in about (Admin, 2019. Good SEO can help with providing good user experience and  increased usability of a website.</p>
