          <h2>Women in development</h2>
         <div class="blog_links">
       
          <p>The number of women in the digital industry is decreasing due to endemic cultural issues (Hughes, 2018). The digital industry is mainly male-centred only 25% of women are part of the digital industry. An article published by <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2018/03/01/exclusive-research-shows-many-women-developers-stuck-junior-level-roles/"><strong> Hacker Rank </strong></a>
  looked at women in development and identified women will always get the junior developer jobs regardless of age, and as the age of a woman increases the opportunities available for women to occupy the senior leadership roles decreases. The following statistics are evidence that women are treated unfairly in the digital industry. Women between the ages of 18 and 24 occupy 84.5% of the junior developer roles compared to 77.3% of men. Women aged between 24 and 35 are 46.1% more likely to obtain junior positions compared to 25.9% of men. Women over the age of 35 are 3.5 times (20.4%) more likely to obtain junior positions compared to 5.9% of men (Hughes, 2018). These statics above show women do have the capability to compete with men and sometimes are even more talented than men than why are they being neglected despite being talented?</p>

<p>10 degrees a software development company state they don’t employ female developers because no female developers apply for the developing role and they understand women are a minority in the industry (Vaughan, 2018). So why are there not many females in the digital industry? After doing some research I found some of the reasons are because not many women are choosing STEM-related subjects like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics because they are gender stereotyped that ‘boys are better at science and maths’ thus discouraging girls. Another reason is that fewer girls are studying STEM-based subject employers are gender-biased when it comings to recruiting employees. Also, according to a survey carried out in America managers are more likely to hire those with similar tastes to them such as hobbies and experiences, therefore, men are more likely to hire men over women. Many people aren’t even aware of the pay gap between men and women. Men are paid double the amount for the same role women do. Women feel isolated at work, there are a hostile macho culture and lack of effective support. Also, some of the biggest companies like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, Google, and Instagram are examples of companies with some of the smallest percentage of female workers (Next generation, 2018).</p>

        <h2>Sucessful women in tech</h2> 

  <p>There are many successful women in the digital industry such as Sara Soueidan a freelance front-end developer and has been nominated as Developer of the year in 2015. Another example of a successful woman in web development is Manal Al-Sharif she was the only woman working as an IT specialist at Saudi Aramco an oil production company and she has been named in the Forbes top 50 for the world’s top 50 women in tech. She is the founder of the Women2Hack academy in Saudi Arabia to help support women who want to be part of the computing industry.</p>
                          
   <h2>My achievements</h2>                       
   <p>I intend to become a front-end web developer and be part of a demanding and fast-paced industry because I enjoy researching, designing and creating websites. I will apply for graduate schemes that are available at university this will give me a better opportunity at gaining a job because I don’t have any professional work experience from the industry.I am confident in HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript however being part of such a competitive industry these coding languages are not enough. After researching I found Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go and Swift are among the upcoming languages for the web industry (Saeed,A. 2018). I will continue to practice and explore some of the languages mentioned above by watching YouTube videos or by reading books about the languages, and then applying my knowledge by creating a website with the new language I have learned.Although there are not many female front-end developers and the industry is dominated by male developers I still intend to part of a male-dominated industry.</p>
